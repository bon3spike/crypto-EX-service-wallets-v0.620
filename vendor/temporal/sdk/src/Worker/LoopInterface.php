     * Likewise, it is imperative to ensure the application actually invokes
     * this method once. Adding listeners to the loop and missing to actually
     * run it will result in the application exiting without actually waiting
     * for any of the attached listeners.

     * This method MUST NOT be called while the loop is already running.
